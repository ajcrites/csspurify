csspurify is a library written in PHP that parses a CSS file and emits rulesets based on a user-provided
whitelist or blacklist.  This simple library was written as a solution for sanitizing user-provided CSS
files to prevent malicious website activity while allowing for customization.

Currently csspurify requires some knowledge of php code to write the whitelist and blacklists and to call the
purifier.
